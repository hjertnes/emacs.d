# README

This is my Emacs config, I use it to write Clojure code at home, JavaScript, C# and Cucumber at work; and to blog using Hugo and Markdown. I also manage my life with Taskpaper. 

Look through the code for deatils, it is well commented. This is the basic structure of my config files:
 
 - init.el - some bootstrapping mostly just loads hjertnes.org
 - hjertnes.org is my configuration as a org document. The main advantages to it is that it is much easier to organize (pun intended) and that it kind of encourage you to write a lot of comments.
